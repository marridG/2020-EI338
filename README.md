# 2020 EI338
Computer Systems Engineering *(Operating Systems & Computer Architecture)*

2020 Fall, SJTU

**By Prof. J. Li**

<br>

For lab projects, [Learning-EI338 @keithnull](https://github.com/keithnull/Learning-EI338/) is strongly recommended for reference *(most APIs are not introduced during lectures)*.  

Handouts for the lab projects are exactly on *Operating System Concepts (10th Edition) by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, Greg Gagne*, with [source codes](https://github.com/greggagne/osc10e) provided.  

For F18 this year, reports are required only for submission. Besides, a simple final presentation, covering all projects and focusing only on the functionalities, is included (by Prof J.) after the final exam.
